// What is a closure?
// A closure is an inner function that has access to the
//  outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. 
//  The closure has three scope chains: it has access to 
//  its own scope (variables defined between its curly 
//     brackets), it has access to the outer function’s 
//     variables, and it has access to the global 
//     variables.

// The inner function has access not only to the outer 
// function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s
//  parameters. Note that the inner function cannot 
//  call the outer function’s arguments object, however, 
//  even though it can call the outer function’s 
//  parameters directly.

// You create a closure by adding a function inside 
// another function.
// A Basic Example of Closures in JavaScript: 

function showName (firstName, lastName) {
    var nameIntro = "Your name is ";
        // this inner function has access to the outer function's variables, including the parameter
    function makeFullName () {  
        return nameIntro + firstName + " " + lastName;   
    }

    return makeFullName ();
}

showName ("Michael", "Jackson"); // Your name is Michael Jackson
